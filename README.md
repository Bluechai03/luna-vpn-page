## About The Project

This was a project created for one of my university modules, Responsive Web. The goal was to create a website and apply key principles of responsiveness. We were also advised to take user experience into account.

The concept I decided for this project is a single-page landing page for a fictional VPN service called Luna. The purpose of this website is to display all the information a potential user would like to see before availing for the service. I took into account user experience and accomplished this by adding smooth animations and creating a navigation menu.

### Features

- Information about features and pricing of the VPN service
- Interactable buttons
- Navigation bar fixed to the top of the page, then transforming to a hamburger menu for smaller screen sizes
- Animations throughout the entire page, including animation of sections when scrolling
- An interactable 'demo' section at the end of the page, showcasing how the VPN would function

### Built With

- [HTML5](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/)
- [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/)
- [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/)
- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
